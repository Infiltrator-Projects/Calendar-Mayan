# Maya Long Count Calendar

**InfiltratorOS calendar resource** · **Stable ID:** `mayan` · **Module:** `Maya Long Count Calendar.so`

Arithmetic Maya Long Count with GMT correlation 584283 and reversible pre-epoch day counts.

**Historical scope/accuracy:** Alternative scholarly correlations exist; GMT absolute correlation is a stated model choice.

**Intended installation:** `/System/Resources/Calendars/Maya Long Count Calendar.so` (case-sensitive)

The provider owns fields, localized formatting, period starts and navigation. Field extraction determines the supported date domain; every other operation must reject the same invalid input. Switching calendar presentation cannot rewrite canonical instants or event ordering.

## Status

**Source copied and build verified.** This repository contains the implementation of `mayan`, the supporting code it needs, a one-provider `Makefile` and focused regression fixtures. The copy is based on Common 1.19.78 at `8d60662114e3`; the original Common source remains unchanged.

Run `make` to produce `build/Maya Long Count Calendar.so` and `make check` to run this provider's checks. No Common checkout or Common archive is required. The current combined Common package and its installation ownership remain in place; this copy does not introduce an independent installer or release.

See [source provenance and build details](SOURCE.md), [source manifest](SOURCE-MANIFEST.json) and [recorded validation](VALIDATION-RESULTS.json).

## Independent forensic audit

See [audit findings](docs/FORENSIC-AUDIT.md) for corrections, numerical-model limits and unresolved authority disagreements. A successful build is not a historical-accuracy certificate.
